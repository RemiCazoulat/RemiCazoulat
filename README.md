### About me
I am a student in computer science, and what I like is optimisation and the laws of physics. To link those two fields, I've started doing simulation on GPU of physical behaviors. I would like to create systems where we can visualise fluids behavior, charged particles around magnets, or maybe both, by simulating plasma ! I would like also to simulate interactions between molecules or atoms.  
### finished projects
  - Magnet simulation. I've created on Unity a project that allows the user to create magnets (in various forms like a solenoid, a tore, or a tokamak) and particles. I'm calculating using the GPU all the interactions between magnets and particles, according to their parameters (charge, mass, distance, speed, etc...).
  - Fabric and solid simulation. During a school project we learned how to simulate those things using a mass-spring system.

### Ongoing projects
  - Fluid simulation.  I've created a C++ and OpenGL project to calculate and display a grid in 2D that mimic the behavior of a fluid.
  - Water simulation. I followed a tutorial made by Acerola that explain how to simulate a realistic ocean. It was my first introduction to shaders and GPU coding.

### Future projects
  - Plasma simulation.
  - atoms'interactions simulation
